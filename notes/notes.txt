npm i -g nodemon => By installing nodemon we dont need to restart server again and again it automatically updates the server.
When ever we are listenting from server when ever the req is comming to server the code will start running from the top
it starts matching the route from the start
if the path is /hello it will retun the res result from /hello req handlers 
if it is not /hello it will go the next req handler and check the path 
And the order of the path is very very very important

http methods
get
Create

http://localhost:3000/xyz => When ever you type in some urlyou are basically making an get api call to http://localhost:3000/xyz 
this route on our server
By default when ever you write an url on top of the browser that is an get api call
How do we make a post api call?
For testing our api's we will not be using our browser
use postman
